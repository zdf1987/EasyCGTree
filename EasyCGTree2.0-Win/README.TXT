EasyCGTree is An Easy Tool for Constructing Core-Gene Tree.

EasyCGTree is a Perl script, developed to construct phylogenetic tree by taking microbial genomes or proteomes in fasta format and reference sequences (protein) of a set of core genes as input data. It has integrated all the steps needed between the input data and the resulted tree file into one Perl script, which would make it easier to infer a core-gene tree.

For the installation and usage of EasyCGTree, please refer to Manual-EasyCGTree.pdf.

There is also a brief tutorial in Manual-EasyCGTree.pdf.
